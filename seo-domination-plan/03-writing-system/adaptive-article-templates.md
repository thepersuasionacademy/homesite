# Adaptive Article Structure Templates

## ðŸŽ¯ **Core Writing Principles (Apply to ALL Templates)**

### **Conversational Mastery Rules:**
1. **Start with provocative truth** - Challenge conventional thinking immediately
2. **Use "uncomfortable reality" language** - "The uncomfortable truth is..." / "Here's what nobody talks about..."
3. **Direct reader address** - "You" language throughout, never "one should" or "people can"
4. **Contrasting statements** - "Most experts say X, but here's what actually works..."
5. **Rhetorical engagement** - Questions that make readers think, not just read
6. **Story-like progression** - Build narrative tension toward resolution

### **Authority Signals (Weave Throughout):**
- **Original frameworks** with memorable acronyms
- **Myth-busting** conventional wisdom with evidence
- **Cross-domain connections** linking psychology, neuroscience, business
- **Systematic methodologies** that demonstrate deep thinking
- **Future-focused insights** showing where the field is heading
