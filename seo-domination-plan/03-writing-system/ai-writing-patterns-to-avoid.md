# AI Writing Patterns to Avoid: The "Robot Voice" Detection Guide

## 🚨 **Common AI Writing Tells That Scream "Generated Content"**

*Keep this list handy when editing to ensure your writing sounds authentically human*

---

## 📝 **Formulaic Language Patterns**

### **❌ Pattern: "It's not just X, it's Y" / "This isn't just about X, it's also about Y"**
**Why it flags AI:** Too neat, comparative formula that AI overuses
**✅ Human alternative:** 
- "Many think X — but Y changes everything"
- Break into two shorter sentences
- "X seems obvious. Here's what actually matters: Y"

### **❌ Pattern: "It was not this... it was that" (corrective structure)**
**Why it flags AI:** Mirrors the contrastive style AI defaults to
**✅ Human alternative:**
- "X seems right, but consider Y"
- Use rhetorical questions: "Think it's X? Actually..."
- "Everyone assumes X. The reality? Y."

### **❌ Pattern: Constant "three" lists (triads)**
**Why it flags AI:** AI resorts to "three steps/reasons/ways" as statistically safe
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use lists of 2, 4, 5, or 7 items
- Break lists into flowing prose
- "Here are the key factors..." (without numbering)

---

## 🔗 **Overused Connectors & Transitions**

### **❌ Pattern: Excessive em dashes (—) everywhere**
**Why it flags AI:** LLMs insert em dashes liberally (Reddit calls this "The em dash tell!")
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use commas, parentheses, or split sentences
- Save em dashes for dramatic emphasis only
- Vary punctuation naturally

### **❌ Pattern: Formal connectors overused**
**Examples:** "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In conclusion," "It is important to note"
**Why it flags AI:** AI uses these by default to structure content
**✅ Human alternative:**
- "But here's what matters..."
- "So what changes?"
- "The thing is..."
- Use structural breaks instead

---

## 🎯 **Generic Amplifier Phrases**

### **❌ Pattern: "The real issue/trick/key"**
**Why it flags AI:** Feels like clickbait framing that AI gravitates toward
**✅ Human alternative:**
- "What often gets overlooked is..."
- "A surprising factor is..."
- "The thing that changes everything..."

### **❌ Pattern: "More than ever," "more and more," "even more so"**
**Why it flags AI:** AI uses these to artificially amplify statements
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use specific data: "Since 2020, X has increased by Y%"
- "Today's reality is..."
- "The current landscape shows..."

---

## 🤔 **Hedging & Uncertainty Language**

### **❌ Pattern: Excessive hedging in every sentence**
**Examples:** "may," "might," "could," "typically," "generally," "tends to"
**Why it flags AI:** Makes writing wobbly and noncommittal
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use direct statements when confident
- Save hedging for genuine uncertainty
- "In most cases..." (then be direct)

### **❌ Pattern: Overly neutral/balanced on every point**
**Why it flags AI:** AI plays both sides to avoid taking stances
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Pick a direction and argue clearly
- Acknowledge counterpoints after making your case
- Have opinions and defend them

---

## 🌍 **Generic Metaphors & Clichés**

### **❌ Pattern: "In the world/landscape/realm of X"**
**Why it flags AI:** AI uses these landscape metaphors constantly
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use concrete, specific metaphors
- Create unique metaphors tied to your subject
- Skip metaphors entirely for direct language

### **❌ Pattern: Stock closers**
**Examples:** "At the end of the day," "when all is said and done"
**Why it flags AI:** Overused, predictable endings
**✅ Human alternative:**
- "The bottom line?"
- "What this means for you..."
- End with insights or questions

---

## 🔄 **Repetition & Echo Patterns**

### **❌ Pattern: Repeating phrases/synonym swapping**
**Why it flags AI:** AI reuses or slightly tweaks phrases for coherence
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Vary structure completely
- Change phrasing entirely
- Read aloud to catch echoes

### **❌ Pattern: Starting sentences with "And," "But," "Also"**
**Why it flags AI:** AI overuses these connectors
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use them sparingly for emphasis
- Vary sentence openings naturally
- Sometimes just start with the main point

---

## 👤 **Voice & Personality Issues**

### **❌ Pattern: Overly polished "smooth" prose**
**Why it flags AI:** Lacks human idiosyncrasies and voice quirks
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Leave small wrinkles: fragments, digressions
- Include rhetorical "uh" or "I wondered"
- Show personality through word choice

### **❌ Pattern: Absence of personal pronouns**
**Why it flags AI:** AI stays impersonal by default
**✅ Human alternative:**
- Use "I/me/us/we/you" appropriately
- Call the reader in directly
- Share personal perspective when relevant

---

## 🎨 **Advanced Human Voice Techniques**

### **Add Authentic Imperfections:**
