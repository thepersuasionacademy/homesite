# Catalysts

Master the powerful catalysts that create breakthrough moments in selling and influence.

## Understanding Catalysts

Catalysts are specific techniques and approaches that can create rapid, positive change in how people think, feel, and make decisions. They work by triggering shifts at the deeper layers of worldview.

## The Two Primary Catalysts

### Ownership Catalyst
Helps prospects take full ownership of their decisions, problems, and solutions. When people own something, they're naturally more committed to it.

### Realization Catalyst
Creates moments of insight and understanding that shift perspective. These "aha" moments can instantly change how someone sees their situation.

## How Catalysts Work

Catalysts operate by:
- Engaging multiple layers of worldview simultaneously
- Creating emotional resonance
- Shifting perspective quickly
- Building intrinsic motivation
- Reducing resistance

## Ethical Application

Catalysts should always be used:
- In service of the prospect's best interests
- To reveal truth, not manipulate
- To create genuine value
- With respect for individual autonomy

Explore each catalyst to learn specific techniques and applications.
