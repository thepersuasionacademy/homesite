# Layers of Worldview

Understand the seven interconnected layers that shape human perception and decision-making.

## The Worldview Model

The Layers of Worldview model reveals how people construct their reality through seven interconnected layers. Understanding these layers allows you to work more effectively with how people think, feel, and make decisions.

## The Seven Layers

### 1. Thoughts
Surface-level mental activity - the conscious stream of ideas, observations, and mental chatter.

### 2. Emotions  
Feeling states that drive behavior - the emotional responses that color our experience.

### 3. Actions
Observable behaviors and habits - what people actually do in the world.

### 4. Beliefs
Convictions about how the world works - the mental models that guide interpretation.

### 5. Values
Core principles and priorities - what matters most to a person.

### 6. Roles
Social and professional identities - how people see themselves in relation to others.

### 7. Identity
Core sense of self - the deepest level of who someone believes they are.

## How the Layers Interact

Each layer influences the others in complex ways. Changes at deeper layers (Identity, Roles, Values) tend to create more lasting transformation than surface-level changes.

### The Depth Principle
- **Surface layers** (Thoughts, Emotions, Actions) change easily but revert quickly
- **Middle layers** (Beliefs, Values) provide stability and direction
- **Deep layers** (Roles, Identity) create lasting transformation when shifted

## Applications in DreamState Selling

- **Understanding resistance** to change by identifying which layer is creating friction
- **Creating lasting behavioral shifts** by working at the appropriate depth
- **Designing compelling offers** that resonate across multiple layers
- **Building deeper relationships** by connecting at the values and identity levels

## Practical Implementation

When working with prospects:
1. **Listen for layer indicators** in their language and concerns
2. **Match your approach** to the appropriate layer depth
3. **Create alignment** across multiple layers for maximum impact
4. **Respect the natural hierarchy** - deeper changes take more time and trust

Explore each layer to master this powerful framework for understanding human motivation and decision-making.
