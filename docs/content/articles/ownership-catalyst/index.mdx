# The Ownership Catalyst

Master the art of helping prospects take full ownership of their decisions, problems, and solutions.

## Understanding the Ownership Catalyst

The Ownership Catalyst is a powerful technique that helps prospects take psychological ownership of their situation, decisions, and outcomes. When people truly own something, they become naturally motivated to act and follow through.

## The Psychology of Ownership

### Ownership Effects
- **Increased Value**: People value what they own more highly
- **Commitment**: Ownership creates natural commitment
- **Responsibility**: Owners feel responsible for outcomes
- **Investment**: Psychological investment increases with ownership

### Types of Ownership
- **Problem Ownership**: "This is my challenge to solve"
- **Solution Ownership**: "This is my chosen approach"
- **Decision Ownership**: "This is my decision to make"
- **Outcome Ownership**: "This is my result to achieve"
