# Layers of Worldview

Understand the seven interconnected layers that shape human perception and decision-making.

## The Worldview Model

The Layers of Worldview model reveals how people construct their reality through seven interconnected layers. Understanding these layers allows you to work more effectively with how people think, feel, and make decisions.

## The Seven Layers

1. **Thoughts** - Surface-level mental activity
2. **Emotions** - Feeling states that drive behavior
3. **Actions** - Observable behaviors and habits
4. **Beliefs** - Convictions about how the world works
5. **Values** - Core principles and priorities
6. **Roles** - Social and professional identities
7. **Identity** - Core sense of self

## How the Layers Interact

Each layer influences the others in complex ways. Changes at deeper layers (Identity, Roles, Values) tend to create more lasting transformation than surface-level changes.

## Applications

- Understanding resistance to change
- Creating lasting behavioral shifts
- Designing compelling offers
- Building deeper relationships

Explore each layer to master this powerful framework.
