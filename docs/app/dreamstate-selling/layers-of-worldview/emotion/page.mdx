- **Secondary**: Emotions about emotions (shame about fear, anger about sadness)

### Emotional Patterns
- Recurring emotional states
- Emotional triggers and responses
- Emotional habits and defaults
- Emotional intelligence levels

## Emotional Influence Techniques

### Creating Positive States
- Using stories to evoke emotions
- Anchoring positive feelings to your solution
- Managing emotional objections
- Building emotional momentum

### Reading Emotional Signals

- Energy shifts in conversation
- Emotional congruence vs. incongruence

## Connection to Other Layers

- **Thoughts**: Emotions color thinking patterns
- **Actions**: Emotional states drive behaviors
- **Beliefs**: Core beliefs create emotional patterns
- **Values**: Value conflicts create emotional tension
