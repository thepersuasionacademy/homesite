# Identity

Master the deepest layer of worldview - core identity and sense of self.

## The Identity Layer

Identity is the deepest and most powerful layer of worldview. It represents who people believe themselves to be at their core. Identity drives all other layers and is the source of the strongest motivation and resistance.

## Core Identity Elements

### Self-Concept
- "I am..."
- Core personality traits
- Fundamental characteristics
- Defining qualities

### Identity Stories
- Personal narratives and myths
- Origin stories and defining moments
- Success and failure narratives
- Future self visions

### Identity Boundaries
- What fits with their identity
- What feels foreign or wrong
- Identity-threatening situations
- Identity-enhancing opportunities

## Identity Dynamics

### Identity Consistency
- People act in ways consistent with identity
- Identity violations create psychological stress
- Identity-aligned actions feel natural
- Identity conflicts create resistance

### Identity Evolution
- How identity changes over time
- Catalysts for identity shifts
- Identity expansion vs. identity threat
- Supporting identity development

## Working with Identity

### Identity Discovery
- "How do you see yourself?"
- "What kind of person are you?"
- "What's most important about who you are?"
- Listen for identity language

### Identity Alignment
- Frame solutions as identity-congruent
- Show how decisions reflect their identity
- Address identity-based objections
- Support positive identity development

### Identity Bridging
- Help people see new aspects of themselves
- Expand identity boundaries gradually
- Create identity-safe change
- Use aspirational identity appeals

## The Ultimate Layer

Identity is the most powerful layer because:
- It drives all other layers
- It creates the strongest motivation
- It generates the most resistance when threatened
- It offers the most leverage when aligned
